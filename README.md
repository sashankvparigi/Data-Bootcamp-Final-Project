Project Description

As the P2P Lending sphere develops, a unique opportunity for economic analysis is presented. Many of these
platforms are as transparent as possible to encourage investors to utilize public data and develop strategies.
For Lending Club in particular, almost every single loan processed through their standard program is cleansed
of identifying information and published to their site. For now, the dataset is mostly useful for investors in either
Lending Club loans or Lending Club's equity, but eventually, the combined datasets of P2P lenders could
provide an interesting look at consumer credit details. Currently, macro factors are likely influences on demand
for P2P loans, but maybe one day P2P loan demand itself could be a macro factor. In the project, I'll be
identifying some characteristics of the dataset that will help put the space in context.

To summarize, the lending club dataset reveals that the bulk of loans are still concentrated in debt consolidation and credit card refinancing. However, there is a noticeable trend in more consumption-oriented loans. The average lending club customer has a far healthier debt and income profile than the average American, meaning that it is not yet as reflective of general American consumption trends as it could be. Geaographic breakdowns show that states that were hit hardest in the housing crisis have a particular demand for P2P lending. Finally, the regression output shows that Change in Consumer Credit, Unemployment, and interest rates all have a significant impact on demand for loans.
